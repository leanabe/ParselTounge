# variables are like 'boxes' that can hold different data
# from different types

number = 100 # in this case the variable number will store the number 100
# numbers without . are called integers

number_with_point = 12.3 # this is called a float, when our variable name needs more than
# one word we use a _ to split them, this practice is called snake case

name = "leila" # when we want to store words we hold the characters between simple or
# double quotes, this is called a String (b/c is a string of characters)

# now we can print them w/ the print command from the previous example

print "Name is:"
print name
print "Number w/ point is:"
print number_with_point
print "Number is:"
print number


# we can also assing multiple variables at once:

first_number = second_number = third_number = 10

print "This numbers were all assinged w/ the same value"
print first_number
print second_number
print third_number
